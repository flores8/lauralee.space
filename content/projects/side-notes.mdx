# Side Notes

A personal archive of quotes, thoughts, and ideas that have struck a chord with me. This project serves as a bridge between my reading and writing, capturing the moments of insight and connection that emerge from consuming and creating content.

## What It Is

Side Notes is more than just a collection of quotes. It's a living archive that:

- **Captures inspiration** from books, articles, conversations, and experiences
- **Connects ideas** across different sources and time periods  
- **Preserves context** about where, when, and why something resonated
- **Links to my ecosystem** of reading and writing content
- **Tracks the evolution** of my thinking over time

## Features

### Rich Content Types
- **Quotes**: Direct excerpts from books and articles
- **Thoughts**: Personal reflections and insights
- **Ideas**: Concepts worth exploring further
- **Insights**: Connections and realizations

### Contextual Information
- Source attribution (book, article, conversation)
- Page numbers and chapter references
- Date and mood when captured
- Personal notes and reactions
- Tags for organization and discovery

### Connected Experience
- Links to related books in my reading list
- Connections to my writing posts
- Tag-based discovery across all content
- Inspiration trails showing how ideas evolved

## The Vision

This project embodies my belief that knowledge is not just accumulated but connected. Each note is a node in a network of ideas, and the real value emerges from the relationships between them.

By connecting my Side Notes to my reading and writing, I create a feedback loop of inspiration and reflection that enhances both my consumption and creation of content.

## The Vision

This project serves as a gentle reminder of life's finite nature and the importance of making meaningful choices. It's not meant to be morbid, but rather to provide perspective that can help prioritize what truly matters.

By visualizing time in this way, we can better appreciate the present moment and make more intentional decisions about how we spend our days.

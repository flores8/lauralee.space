Norman's foundational work on user-centered design principles. Essential reading for anyone involved in creating products that people actually use.

## Key Takeaways

- Good design is invisible - it just works
- Affordances and signifiers guide user behavior
- When people can't use something, it's usually a design problem, not a user problem
- Feedback and discoverability are crucial

## Design Principles

1. **Visibility** - Make important parts visible
2. **Feedback** - Give clear feedback about what's happening
3. **Constraints** - Limit the possible actions
4. **Mapping** - Make the relationship between controls and actions clear
5. **Consistency** - Be consistent in design patterns
6. **Affordances** - Design things to suggest their function

# 🌙 lauralee.space

**Welcome to my digital sketchbook.**  
This is my personal corner of the internet - unfiltered, evolving, and deeply mine. Here, I write, share what I’m reading, and experiment with ideas that don’t need to be portfolio-ready or professionally polished. It’s where curiosity leads and the rules get to bend.

## ✨ About This Space

Unlike my portfolio or professional narrative, this site is intentionally messy in the best way. It’s a playground, not a pitch.  
A space to chase sparks of inspiration, document half-formed thoughts, and explore whatever’s pulling my attention.

📚 **Writing & Reading**  
Expect musings, essays, and meanderings—alongside books I’m loving or learning from.

🧪 **Creative Experiments**  
Design tests, side projects, and imperfect ideas in motion.

🖋️ **No Pressure to Perform**  
This space isn’t trying to sell anything. It’s here so I can think out loud.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The look and feel of `lauralee.space` reflect the freedom I want when I create:

- **Editorial-inspired:** Clean typography, generous whitespace, and a reading experience that feels good.
- **Organic & Asymmetric:** Think lo-fi visuals, unexpected layouts, and touches of surprise.
- **Tactile textures:** Scanned elements, paper edges, hand-drawn sketches—a nod to the analog world.
- **Minimal, but human:** Simplicity that supports focus, punctuated by moments of personality.

## 🛠️ Tech & Style

- **Typography:** A warm serif (like EB Garamond) paired with playful sans-serifs (Inter).
- **Color palette:** Soft neutrals with splashes of cobalt, dusty pink, or acid green.
- **Motion:** Gentle microinteractions—think sticky notes peeling up on hover.
- **Imagery:** Lo-fi, personal, and imperfect is the point.
